Getting started
---------------

The quickest way to get started is by downloading and running an example.
On https://bitbucket.org/robotframework/webdemo/wiki/Home you'll find a good
example that runs directly.
  wget https://bitbucket.org/robotframework/webdemo/downloads/WebDemo-20130308.zip
Unzip and run the testcases by using following syntax:
  pybot <path to testcase>


Using different browsers
------------------------
- Chrome: First you'll have to download the ChromeDriver and put it in the path.
          Download the latest release on http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
          Unzip and move content to /usr/local/bin

 For using another browser using pybot simply type:
  pybot --variable BROWSER:Chrome <path to testcase>
  pybot --variable BROWSER:IE     <path to testcase>
